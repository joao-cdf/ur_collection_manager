This is as far as I have been able to make it before getting stuck. I have been
unable to correctly construct a call to be passed to the API. All attempts that
I have made to construct a call have resulted in 404 errors which UR defines as:
"non valid call (check your syntax)". 

The code inside this block comment is merely one version of the many variations 
I attempted.

call = {'call': 'characters.getCharacters',
        'params' : {'charactersIDs':300}}

json_call = ujson.encode(call)

r = oauth.request('get', url=api_target, params=json_call)

print(r.status_code, r.url, r.text)
